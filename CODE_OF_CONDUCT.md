# Project-ESGI-3SI-pacman Code of Conduct

## Purpose

The Project-ESGI-3SI-pacman community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the project maintainers.

## Code of Conduct

### 1. Be Respectful

Treat others with respect and kindness. Do not insult or put down others. Remember that harassment and exclusionary behavior are never acceptable.

### 2. Inclusive Language

Use inclusive language that welcomes and respects all individuals, regardless of background. Be mindful of your language and its impact on others.

### 3. No Harassment

Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
   - Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
   - Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices.
   - Deliberate misgendering or use of deadnames.

### 4. Be Collaborative

Strive to help each other. If you disagree, express your views without disrespect. Remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

### 5. Reporting Violations

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report it to the project maintainers at [vshao2@myges.fr]. All reports will be kept confidential.
